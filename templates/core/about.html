            The MMT Budget Response Suite is a real-time platform for tracking, fact-checking, and rebutting
            budget myths from a Modern Monetary Theory perspective.

        <h2>Why This Platform?</h2>
        <p>
            Every budget day, the same economic myths are repeated: "taxpayer money," "maxed out credit card,"
            "balancing the books." This platform provides tools to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track these myths in real-time with Budget Bingo</li>
            <li>Crowdsource and AI-verify fact-checks with MMT analysis</li>
            <li>Generate comprehensive rebuttals for activists, MPs, and media</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <h3>Budget Bingo</h3>
        <p>
